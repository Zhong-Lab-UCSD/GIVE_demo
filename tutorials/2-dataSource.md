## Prerequisites

To follow the tutorial, a functional MySQL-compatible instance and a PHP web server is required. For this demo, we will be using the GIVE Demo Server at demo.give.genemo.org as a PHP-supported web server linked to a working MariaDB instance. Follow these steps to connect to the demo server:

***

*__NOTE:__ You may want to use your own server / database to complete these demo steps so that you may have a better understanding of the underlying components. Please refer to the following resources for installing your own MySQL instance:*
*   *[MySQL community server](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)*
*   *[MariaDB](https://downloads.mariadb.org/)*

*You may also follow the instructions here to install PHP to your web server:*
*   *[PHP installation and configuration](http://php.net/manual/en/install.php)*
*   *[cURL library](http://php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php) (a required PHP component for GIVE).*

*If you haven't set up your web server, please refer to [Tutorial 1, Part "Prerequisites"](knownCodeDataSource.md#prerequisites) for instructions.*  
*If you decide to use your own MySQL instance and PHP server, please change the steps involving GIVE Demo Server accordingly and __follow all optional set-up steps__.*

***

1.  Please go to the following address to request an MySQL account and create a reference database:
<https://demo.give.genemo.org/getDemoUser.html>  
    You will get a username, a password and a database name for later steps in the demo.  
    The username will be referred to as `your_database_username`, the password as `password_for_your_database_user`, the database name as `your_reference_database`. __Whenever you see those name in the following steps, please replace those with what you get here.__

2.  Use an SSH client to connect to GIVE Demo Server at `demo.give.genemo.org` with the following username and password to login. __Don't use your allocated username and password yet!__
    *   If you are using Mac OS or Linux, please use the following command:
        ```
        ssh givdemo@demo.give.genemo.org
        givdemo@demo.give.genemo.org's password: HTML4GenomeVis
        ```
    *   If you are using windows, please use an SSH client, such as  [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) to connect with the following parameters:  
        Host name: `demo.give.genemo.org`  
        port: `22`  
        connection type: `SSH`  
        When prompted, use the following information to login:
        ```
        login as: givdemo
        givdemo@demo.give.genemo.org's password: HTML4GenomeVis
        ```

3.  Use the console to login to MySQL:
    ```sh
    $ mysql -u <your_database_username> -p
    Enter password: <password_for_your_database_user>
    ```

    When you logged in successfully, you'll see something like the following in your console:

    ```text
    Welcome to the MariaDB monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
    Your MariaDB connection id is 28348
    Server version: 10.1.21-MariaDB-1~xenial mariadb.org binary distribution

    Copyright (c) 2000, 2016, Oracle, MariaDB Corporation Ab and others.

    Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

    MariaDB [(none)]>_
    ```

4.  All SQL commands in following steps can be directly put under this console (with essential parts replaced).

## Demo: creating a *Vulcan* reference genome and visualize something on it

Here we will demonstrate an example of using GIVE with the MySQL data source on Zhong Lab server.

> *It's the 2260s. Human beings have mastered the technologies required in intergalactic travel.* USS Enterprise *was just launched a few years ago to explore the final frontier of space.*
>
> *However, the understanding of our sibling sentient species is still quite lacking. For example, our knowledge of the mystic species of* Vulcans *is extremely limited, despite almost 200 years of contact between them and us.*
>
> *News came that scientists have just assembled the entire genome with a sample from a* Vulcan *subject, got a few annotations done and measured some epigenetic signals and genomic interactions. There are obviously a lot of work to do, but as astrobiologists, we would like to check if we can see anything from what we already got.*

### OPTIONAL: Preparation for GIVE

***

*__Note:__ If you are using the MariaDB instance on demo.give.genemo.org, your MariaDB account will not have the privilege to do the steps in this section. If you try any commands listed here, you will receive a message from MariaDB saying the operation is denied.  
These steps are automatically done for you after you requested for a database username, password, and database name. Therefore, __please skip this section entirely and go to Step 6.__*

***

*   Create a database named `compbrowser`:
    ```SQL
    CREATE DATABASE `compbrowser`;
    ```
    This database serves as the vital connection between GIVE server and the database source.

*   Within the `compbrowser` database, create a table named `ref`:
    ```SQL
    CREATE TABLE `compbrowser`.`ref` (
     `name` char(100) DEFAULT NULL,   -- The name of the species of the reference
     `dbname` char(30) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',   -- The database name
     `commonname` char(50) DEFAULT NULL,      -- The common name of the species
     `encode` tinyint(4) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,      -- Whether it's part of ENCODE
     `specdatabase` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,    -- Reserved for GeNemo use
     `genomeSize` int(11) unsigned DEFAULT NULL,  -- Reserved for GeNemo use
     `browserActive` tinyint(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0', -- Whether the ref is active
     `givdbname` varchar(255) NOT NULL DEFAULT '', -- Reserved for GeNemo use
     `settings` longtext NOT NULL,    -- Detailed settings for the reference, JSON format
     PRIMARY KEY (`dbname`)
    )
    ```
    This table is needed to store the properties of all supported references.

    The data source will have a data structure as shown below:

    ![UML Diagram for the database](2-extraFiles/GIVE_DB_comp.png)

### Preparation for reference genome
#### Creating a new reference genome

> *Preliminary examinations revealed that this sample greatly resembles an ancient human genome assembly published about 250 years ago, the NCBI* `GRCh37` *(UCSC* `hg19` *). This is very intriguing and has casted doubt on the validity of the sample, but at least it will be easy for us to see.*

To visualize a new reference genome, GIVE only needs to know 1) the names of the species for this reference (Latin and common names are recommended but any name should work), 2) its chromosomal information, including names, sizes and the location of centromeres. These are stored in two locations within the data source, which can be done in the following steps:

5.  Create a separate database for the reference, this database will be used to store all the track information within this species;

    ***

    *__Note:__ If you are using the MariaDB instance on demo.give.genemo.org, __please skip this step and go to step 6.__*

    ***

    ```SQL
    CREATE DATABASE `<your_reference_database>`;
    ```
6.  Create a `cytoBandIdeo` table with chromosomal information in the *Vulcan* species database;
    ```SQL
    CREATE TABLE `<your_reference_database>`.`cytoBandIdeo` (
      `chrom` varchar(255) NOT NULL,          -- Chromosomal name
      `chromStart` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL, -- Start coordinate for the band
      `chromEnd` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL,   -- End coordinate for the band
      `name` varchar(255) NOT NULL,           -- Name of the band
      `gieStain` varchar(255) NOT NULL,       -- Giemsa Stain info, to identify bands, centromeres, etc.
      KEY `chrom` (`chrom`(23),`chromStart`)
    );
    ```

    The data source will now have a data structure as shown below (existing components not changed in structure are greyed out):

    ![UML Diagram for the database](2-extraFiles/GIVE_DB_vlc_cyto.png)

7.  Populate the `cytoBandIdeo` table. Since the presumed *Vulcan* genome is very similar to `hg19`, we can use the `cytoBandIdeo` table in UCSC `hg19` instead. The data for `cytoBandIdeo` of `hg19` can be downloaded from <https://sysbio.ucsd.edu/public/xcao3/UFPArchive/cytoBandIdeo.txt> and has already been loaded on the demo server at `/home/givdemo/UFPArchive/cytoBandIdeo.txt`. You can use SQL command to load this file into the table.
    ***
    *__Note:__ Currently several references are provided on the GIVE server at give.genemo.org, please refer to GIVE.*
    ***
    ```SQL
    LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE "/home/givdemo/UFPArchive/cytoBandIdeo.txt" INTO TABLE `<your_reference_database>`.`cytoBandIdeo`;
    ```
8.  Add one entry in table `ref` of database `compbrowser`, notice that the `browserActive` field needs to be set to `1` and in the `settings` field, the JSON string also has its `browserActive` attribute set as `true`; (You may want to try <http://www.objgen.com/json> to get a JSON string with ease.)

    ```SQL
    INSERT INTO `compbrowser`.`ref` (
      `name`,
      `dbname`,
      `commonname`,
      `browserActive`,
      `settings`
    )
    VALUES (
      'Vulcan',
      '<your_reference_database>',   -- *** Please change this name to your own ***
      'Vulcan',
      1,            -- Make it active
      '{
        "browserActive": true
      }'            -- Same here, make it active
    );
    ```

9.  With these steps done, you will be able to specify the *Vulcan* reference in embedded GIVE browser.  
    You can use the following code in CodePen or JSFiddle to see your new reference in motion:  
    (Please refer to [Tutorial 1, Part "Embedding a full-fledged genome browser in existing pages"](knownCodeDataSource.md#embedding-a-full-fledged-genome-browser-in-existing-pages) about how to embed GIVE browser in your web page.)  
    ```html
    <script src="https://demo.give.genemo.org/components/bower_components/webcomponentsjs/webcomponents-lite.min.js"></script>
    <link rel="import" href="https://demo.give.genemo.org/components/bower_components/genemo-visual-components/chart-controller/chart-controller.html">

    <!-- ****** Replace `<your_reference_database>` in the next line with your own DB name ****** -->
    <chart-controller ref="<your_reference_database>" group-id-list='["genes", "epigenetics"]'>
    </chart-controller>
    ```
    Since there was no tracks at all, the only thing you can see in the reference is the chromosomal coordinates. However, this is gonna change soon.

#### Creating track groups

Tracks in GIVE belongs to track groups for better management and these groups need their place in the database.

10. Create a `grp` table in the reference database:

    ```SQL
    CREATE TABLE `<your_reference_database>`.`grp` (
      `name` char(255) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',           -- Name of the group
      `label` char(255) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',          -- Long label of the group
      `priority` float NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',          
      -- Order for this group in the browser, less is upper
      `defaultIsClosed` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,         -- Whether the group will be closed by default, reserved
      `singleChoice` tinyint(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0'
      -- Whether the group will only allow one track to be active at any time
    );
    ```

11. Create three track groups, one for gene annotation (`genes`), one for linear data (`linear_tracks`), and one for interactions (`interactions`):

    ```SQL
    INSERT INTO `<your_reference_database>`.`grp` VALUES ( -- *** Replace `<your_reference_database>` with your own DB name ***
      'genes',                          -- Group name
      'Genes and Gene Predictions',     -- Group long label
      3,                                -- Priority
      0,
      0
    ), (
      'linear_tracks',
      'Linear Tracks',
      4,
      0,
      0
    ), (
      'interactions',
      'Genomic Interactions',
      5,
      0,
      0
    );
    ```

### Creating the track definition table

Tracks themselves also need a place to store their annotation and data. This is achieved by creating a table named `trackDb` in the reference database.

12. Create a `trackDb` table in our *Vulcan* reference database:
    ```SQL
    CREATE TABLE `<your_reference_database>`.`trackDb` (
      `tableName` varchar(150) NOT NULL,    -- Name of the track table
      `type` varchar(255) NOT NULL,         -- Type of the track (**Important**)
      `priority` float NOT NULL,            -- Order for the track (within group)
      `url` longblob,                       -- URL for the track, reserved
      `html` longtext,                      -- HTML description for the track, reserved
      `grp` varchar(255) NOT NULL,          -- Group of the track, should be the same as grp.name
      `settings` longtext NOT NULL,         -- Detailed track settings, JSON format
      PRIMARY KEY (`tableName`)
    );
    ```

The updated data structure as shown below (existing components not changed in structure are greyed out):

![UML Diagram for the database](2-extraFiles/GIVE_DB_vlc_grp_track.png)


### Adding data
#### Adding gene annotations

> *While the actual evidence for* Vulcan *genes are very slim, given its close relationship to the ancient* `hg19` *reference, it appears that whoever generated the annotations just used the human annotation as a guidance to predict where all those* Vulcan *genes may be.*

After track groups were created, we can add tracks into the groups to display. Adding tracks to GIVE database typically involves two steps: one for metadata and one for data.

13. Add the gene annotation data to the database.
    *   Create a `GenePred` table for gene annotation data;

        ***

        *__Note:__ This is different than BED12 format: 1) field order is slightly different; 2) the 9th and 10th column represents the start and end coordinate of all the exons, instead of the start within the gene and length of the exon in BED12.*

        ***
        ```SQL
        CREATE TABLE `<your_reference_database>`.`GenePred` ( -- *** Replace `<your_reference_database>` with your own DB name ***
          `name` varchar(255) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
          `chrom` varchar(255) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
          `strand` char(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
          `txStart` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
          `txEnd` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
          `cdsStart` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
          `cdsEnd` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
          `exonCount` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
          `exonStarts` longblob NOT NULL,
          `exonEnds` longblob NOT NULL,
          `proteinID` varchar(40) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
          `alignID` varchar(255) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
          KEY `name` (`name`),
          KEY `chrom` (`chrom`(16),`txStart`),
          KEY `chrom_2` (`chrom`(16),`txEnd`),
          KEY `protein` (`proteinID`(16)),
          KEY `align` (`alignID`)
        );
        ```
    *   Populate the `GenePred` table with actual data.
        The annotation data we are going to use in this demo is at <https://sysbio.ucsd.edu/public/xcao3/UFPArchive/genepred.txt> and has already been loaded on the demo server at `/home/givdemo/UFPArchive/genepred.txt`. You may use `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE` to add them to the `GenePred` table.
        ```SQL
        LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE "/home/givdemo/UFPArchive/genepred.txt" INTO TABLE `<your_reference_database>`.`GenePred`;
        ```
14. Add the gene annotation track metadata in `trackDb` table;
    ```SQL
    INSERT INTO `<your_reference_database>`.`trackDb` VALUES ( -- *** Replace `<your_reference_database>` with your own DB name ***
      'GenePred',                   -- Track table name
      'genePred',                   -- Track type: gene and gene prediction
      1,
      NULL,
      NULL,
      'genes',                      -- Group name, should be the same as grp.name
      '{
        "group":"genes",
        "longLabel":"Predicted Genes for presumed Vulcan sample (by comparing against hg19)",
        "priority":1,
        "shortLabel":"Predicted Genes",
        "track":"GenePred",
        "type":"genePred",
        "visibility":"pack",
        "adaptive":true
      }'
    );
    ```

#### Adding one epigenetic track

> *Interestingly, there seem to be few discrepancies with the gene prediction data from human when annotating the presumed* Vulcan *sample. We haven't seen the epigenetic signal on the genome yet, but it appears that more caution would be better than less.*

Adding epigenetic tracks (in `bigWig` format) is actually easier than `BED` or `GenePred` tracks. It also involves a data part and a metadata part.

15. Add the epigenetic data to the database.
    *   Create a table for epigenetic data;
        ```SQL
        CREATE TABLE `<your_reference_database>`.`Epi1` (  -- *** Replace `<your_reference_database>` with your own DB name ***
          `fileName` varchar(255) NOT NULL
        );
        ```
    *   For bigWig tracks, only the URL of the data file (<https://sysbio.ucsd.edu/public/xcao3/UFPArchive/vulcanCandidate.bigWig>) needs to be filled in the table.
        ```SQL
        INSERT INTO `<your_reference_database>`.`Epi1` VALUES (  -- *** Replace `<your_reference_database>` with your own DB name ***
          'https://sysbio.ucsd.edu/public/xcao3/UFPArchive/vulcanCandidate.bigWig'
        );
        ```
16. Add the epigenetic track metadata in `trackDb` table;
    ```SQL
    INSERT INTO `<your_reference_database>`.`trackDb` VALUES ( -- *** Replace `<your_reference_database>` with your own DB name ***
      'Epi1',
      'bigWig',
      1,
      NULL,
      NULL,
      'linear_tracks',
      '{
        "autoScale":false,
        "group":"linear_tracks",
        "dataType":"ChipSeq",
        "cellType":"Lymphocyte",
        "trackFeature":"H3K4me3",
        "trackID":"ChIPSeq_H3K4me3_Lymph",
        "labName":"UFP Bio-lab #4201",
        "groupDataType":"ChIP-Seq",
        "groupFeature":"H3K4me3",
        "groupSampleType":"B-lymphocytic",
        "longLabel":"ChIP Sequencing data with H3K4me3 for presumed Vulcan lymphocyte",
        "priority":1,
        "shortLabel":"H3K4me3 (Lymphocyte)",
        "track":"Epi1",
        "type":"bigWig",
        "visibility":"full"
      }'
    );
    ```

    Now the data structure as shown below (existing components not changed in structure are greyed out):

    ![UML Diagram for the database](2-extraFiles/GIVE_DB_vlc_final.png)

> *The striking resemblance of the presumed* Vulcan *genome and epigenome has attracted great attention throughout UFP. However, lots of skeptical UFP scientists, including us, also doubted given such resemblance whether this set of data is genuinely from a* Vulcan *subject, or from some human origin.*

#### Adding interactions

Adding interaction tracks (in `interaction` format) is similar to adding `BED` or `GenePred` tracks. It also involves a data part and a metadata part.

17. Add the interaction data to the database.
    *   Create a `interaction` table for gene annotation data;

        ***

        *__Note:__ This is the interaction format converted for database use. Each interaction component will take at least two rows (one for each end) and linked by having the same `linkID`.*

        ***

        ```SQL
        CREATE TABLE `<your_reference_database>`.`newInteraction` ( -- *** Replace `<your_reference_database>` with your own DB name ***
          `ID` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
          `chrom` varchar(255) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
          `start` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
          `end` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
          `linkID` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
          `value` float NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
          `dirFlag` tinyint(4) NOT NULL DEFAULT '-1',
          PRIMARY KEY (`ID`),
          KEY `chrom` (`chrom`(16),`start`),
          KEY `chrom_2` (`chrom`(16),`end`),
          KEY `linkID` (`linkID`)
        );
        ```
    *   Populate the `newInteraction` table with actual data.
        The annotation data we are going to use in this demo is at <https://sysbio.ucsd.edu/public/xcao3/UFPArchive/newInteraction.txt> and has already been loaded on the demo server at `/home/givdemo/UFPArchive/newInteraction.txt`. You may use `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE` to add them to the `newInteraction` table.
        ```SQL
        LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE "/home/givdemo/UFPArchive/newInteraction.txt" INTO TABLE `<your_reference_database>`.`newInteraction`;
        ```
18. Add the new interaction track metadata in `trackDb` table;
    ```SQL
    INSERT INTO `<your_reference_database>`.`trackDb` VALUES ( -- *** Replace `<your_reference_database>` with your own DB name ***
      'newInteraction',             -- Track table name
      'interaction',                -- Track type: interaction
      1,
      NULL,
      NULL,
      'interactions',               -- Group name, should be the same as grp.name
      '{
        "group":"interactions",
        "longLabel":"Genomic interaction for presumed Vulcan sample",
        "priority":1,
        "shortLabel":"Genomic Interaction",
        "track":"newInteraction",
        "type":"interaction",
        "thresholdPercentile": [
          0.37993920972644379, 1.3297872340425532, 1.7806267806267808,

19. Because two panels are needed to display interactions, you will need to change the embedding HTML code a little bit:  
    ```html
    <script src="https://demo.give.genemo.org/components/bower_components/webcomponentsjs/webcomponents-lite.min.js"></script>
    <link rel="import" href="https://demo.give.genemo.org/components/bower_components/genemo-visual-components/chart-controller/chart-controller.html">

    <!-- ****** Replace `<your_reference_database>` in the next line with your own DB name ****** -->
    <chart-controller ref="<your_reference_database>" group-id-list='["genes", "interactions"]' num-of-subs="2">
    </chart-controller>
    ```

### Epilogue

> *To further clarify the source of this presumed sample, the bio-lab conducting the research turned to experts of all fields. Many experts do not believe that a* Vulcan *sample could bear so much resemblance to a human one, let alone a two-hundred-plus-year old one. The skepticism has grown so significant that the bio-lab tried to contact that* Vulcan *subject to get further details about the sample.*
>
> *And the result is quite surprising: while the sample is indeed __from__ the* Vulcan*, however, it turns out to be not __of__* __Vulcan__ *__origin__ - it's an ancient dataset recovered in a recent expedition and apparently the* Vulcan *subject is an astro-archaeologist with specialization in ancient digital-media restoration. Therefore, the dataset might actually have came from an ancient human, which explains such high resemblance perfectly.*
>
> *That* Vulcan *is surely a master of logic.*
>
> *While the recovered dataset, being more than 250 years ago, has its intrinsic archaeological value, we astrobiologists are definitely out of luck this time and would need to wait for another chance in the future. Maybe when* USS Enterprise *returns to the earth, we can try to contact one of the crew onboard.*

## Database table properties documentation

Here are a brief description of the properties you may use in the `settings` column of `trackDb`:

__shortLabel__  
> Type: `String`  
> Default: `''`  
> The short label shown by the track.

__longLabel__  
> Type: `String`  
> Default: `''`  
> The long label providing more information. Reserved.

__visibility__  
> Type: `enum` (`'full'`, `'pack'`, `'collapsed'`, `'dense'`, and `'hide'`)  
> Default: `'hide'`  
> The visibility of the track, left is more visible/prominent.

__adaptive__  
> Type: `Boolean`  
> Default: `false`  
> Whether the visibility will adapt to the height of the ending result. If the height exceeds certain threshold, the visibility will be degraded by one.

__dataType__, __cellType__, __trackFeature__, __labName__,  
__groupDataType__, __groupFeature__, __groupSampleType__  
> Type: `String`  
> Default: `null`  
> These are metadata of the tracks. Reserved for future features.

__thresholdPercentile__  
> Type: `Array<Number>`  
> Default: `null`  
> A series of numbers defining the percentile of the data points in the track. This is used to color interaction graphs by their corresponding signal level. May be applied to other types of tracks in a future release.
